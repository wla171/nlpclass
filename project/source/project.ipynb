    "In this project, we want to improve an open-domain question answering (QA) system based on Google’s Natural Questions dataset.  Before 2017, the QA system mainly focused on LSTM (RNN) approach; however, RNN has lower performance on prediction speed and costs more training time.  In 2017 Google released a transformer based model BERT,Bidirectional Transformers, which improves overall performance, accuracy and fine tune appoarch for natural language processing task in different domain. In 2019, Google released another improvement model ALBERT, which has lower diemeion on embedding space and used less parameters based on BERT model. Also, DistilBERT model\n",

A notable alumnus of the College of Science is Medicine Nobel Prize winner Eric F. Wieschaus. A number of university heads are alumni, including Notre Dame's current president, the Rev. John Jenkins. Additionally, many alumni are in the media, including talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm. With the university having high profile sports teams itself, a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics outside the university, including professional baseball, basketball, football, and ice hockey players, such as Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Tim Brown, Ross Browner, Rocket Ismail, Ruth Riley, Jeff Samardzija, Jerome Bettis, Brett Lebda, Olympic gold medalist Mariel Zagunis, professional boxer Mike Lee, former football coaches such as Charlie Weis, Frank Leahy and Knute Rockne, and Basketball Hall of Famers Austin Carr and Adrian Dantley.

This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhD programs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\".

    "In conclusion, the project has meet our expectation, and answered three of our aimed research questions. The enesembles method allows us to increase the accuarcy of SQuAD by 1.46% on F1 and  2.99% on EM. Also, increase the accuary on SFU dataset by 2.33% on F1 and 6% on EM.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neural QA model trained on generic dataset perform very well at answering SFU related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model performance increases consistently across all algorithms, because SFU Test Dataset mostly contains short answers focusing on time, names and locations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our Ensemble models improve the overall performance for SFU Test Dataset, however, the prediction time increases significantly"
