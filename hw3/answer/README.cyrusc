1. Implemented the baseline model with option 1, creating a character representation of word and concat with embedding vector
2. Learn to improve the baseline mode with option1, tried with data aggregation and more epoches result can go up to 78.9, but changing hyperparater is not allowed in this assignement
3. instead of changing hyperparater, scaling the loss value which allows us to achieve better result up to 78.7
4. Python notebook writing
